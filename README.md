Major Requirements:- COVID Situation
  ● Once the important parameters(Body Temp, heart rate, o2 ) are recorded, these would be updated accordingly by the testers through the application itself. The testers will then go back to their labs and perform the lab tests on the sample and deduce if the person is tested positive or negative.
  The testers can then accordingly upload the same information on the app.
  These test results can be viewed by the requested patients.
  ● Similarly, on the doctors’ end, a doctor can see the health parameters of the patient and also the test results and accordingly suggest to the patient if he/she is in need for immediate hospitalization or quarantine or can be considered safe. For example, a patient who might have very extreme health parameters such as high temperature & fluctuating breathing may be classified as “In need for immediate hospitalization”.
  ● Finally, the health department should be able to view the details of all patients, ensuring that the required patients are immediately hospitalized. A classification algorithm may also be run to identify the lockdown/unlock protocols of the localities.
